lxir README

lxir is a very configurable tool to convert LaTeX to XML.

Compilation under Unix:

Use the standard "./configure ; make" command.
As of now, the --prefix parameter to configure is mandatory.

Compilation under win32:

The prefered method to compile lxir for win32 is to cross-compile from a unix
environment.
Compilation under Cygwin or Mingw/MSYS should work, but is untested.

Compilation of the tools is not yet supported for the win32 platform.

How to use lxir:

lxir is a command line tool. Although the mean of the lxir system is to convert
LaTex to XML, the lxir command line tool purpose is to convert a tagged DVI file
and log file to the final XML file. Usage is very simple:
"lxir <file.dvi> > <output.xml>".

How to get a tagged DVI file:

In order to generate a tagged DVI file to feed lxir with, you must compile a
slightly modified version of your latex source with latex.

The modifications to your source can be as simple as adding at the start the
following line before the \documentclass entry:

\UsePackage{lxir}
